CSIR-NET June 2015 exam is over. This is the time to build some concept and read something besides exam point of view. This page contain free resource for Abstract Algebra. 

 1. **[Paul Garret Book:](http://www.math.umn.edu/~garrett/m/algebra/notes/Whole.pdf) ** This book contain complete syllabus of abstract algebra for CSIR-NET with good examples and exercises.
 2. **[Robert B. Ash Notes:](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~r-ash/Algebra.html)** These are probably the most popular online notes on abstract algebra. It contains solution of exercises that will be helpful for self learning students. It also contain notes on more advance courses based on algebra which are not contained in the syllabus of CSIR-NET.
 3. **[J. S. Milne Book:](http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/GT.pdf)** This is another very popular online books on abstract algebra similar to first two.
 4.  **[Scott M. LaLonde Course Notes:](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m31x13/Notes%20on%20Abstract%20Algebra%202013.pdf)** If you need a non-conventional student friendly example based book for building some interest and intuition in abstract algebra then go through this book first. It is actually a "A Student Friendly Introduction to Abstract Algebra".


These books are not free but I will mention it for the sake of completeness.

 1. **Topica in Algebra - I. N. Herstein:** This is a classic book on abstract algebra, slightly outdated convention and unusual style makes it difficult to read, but if you read it, it will pay you in compound interest. This book also contain good amount of linear algebra.
 2. **Contemporary Abstract Algebra - Joseph A. Gallian:** It is a modern book with a lot of examples, exercises and application. People will find it relatively easy to follow.
