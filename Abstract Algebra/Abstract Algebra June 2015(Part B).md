**Question 1:** Let $D$ be the set of tuples $(w_1, \cdots , w_{10})$, where $w_i \in \{1, 2, 3\}, ~ 1 \leq i \leq 10$ and $w_i + w_{i+1}$ is an even number for each $i$ with $1 \leq i \leq 9$.  Then the number of elements in $D$ is

1. $2^{11} + 1$
2. $2^{10} + 1$
3. $3^{10} + 1$
4. $3^{11} + 1$

**Answer:** The sum of each subsequent number is even if all the numbers are either even or odd, but not both. When we take even number we have only one choice. When we take odd number we have two choices of odd numbers $\{1,3\}$ at each position hence total number of such sequence will be $2^{10} + 1$.

Hence **2** is correct choice.

**Question 2:** Let $R$ be the ring $\mathbb{Z}[x]/\langle (x^2+x+1)(x^3+x+1)\rangle$ and $I$ be the ideal generated by $2$ in $R$. What is the cardinality of the ring $R$?

1. $27$
2. $32$
3. $64$
4. infinity

**Answer:** For all $c \in  \mathbb{Z}$, $c + \langle (x^2+x+1)(x^3+x+1)\rangle$ will be an element of $R$. Since we have infinite possibility of $c$ hence the cardinality will be at least infinity.

Hence **4** is correct choice.

**Question 3:** Up to isomorphism, the number of Abelian groups of order $108$ is

1. $12$
2. $9$
3. $6$
4. $5$

**Answer:** Since $108 = 2^2 \times 3^3$. Hence number of Abelian groups will $P(2) \times P(3) = 2 \times 3 = 6$, where $P(n)$ is the number of partition of $n$.

Hence **3** is correct choice.

*****
**Qustion 4:** The number of subfields of a field of cardinality $2^{100}$ is

1. $2$
2. $4$
3. $9$
4. $100$

**Answer:** As we know,
> Every subfield of of a field of order $p^n$ will of order $p^m$, where $m | n$.

Here, we have find all the divisors of $n$(also know as $\tau(n)$). $100 = 2^2\times 5^2$, hence $\tau(100) = 3 \times 3 = 9$.

Hence **3** is correct choice.
