####Important results on Convergence of Series

######**Necessary Condition for Convergence:**
If $\sum a_n$ converges then $\lim_{n \to \infty}a_n=0$.

######**Ratio test:**
This is also known as D'Alembert's criterion. Suppose that there exists r such that
$$\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}\lim_{n \to \infty} \left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right| = r.$$

- If $r < 1$, then the series is absolutely convergent.
- If $r > 1$, then the series diverges.
- If $r = 1$, the ratio test is inconclusive, and the series may converge or diverge.

######**Root test:**
This is also known as the nth root test or Cauchy's criterion. Define r as follows:
$$r = \limsup_{n \to \infty}\sqrt[n]{|a_n|},$$

- If r < 1, then the series converges.
- If r > 1, then the series diverges.
- If r = 1, the root test is inconclusive, and the series may converge or diverge.

######**Integral test:**
The series can be compared to an integral to establish convergence or divergence. Let $f:[1,\infty)\to\R_+$ be a non-negative and monotone decreasing function such that $f(n) = a_n$. If

$$\int_{1}^{\infty} f(x)\, dx = \lim_{t \to \infty} \int_{1}^{t} f(x)\, dx < \infty,$$
then the series converges or diverges simultaneously.

######**Direct comparison test:**
If the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n$ is an absolutely convergent series and $|a_n|\le |b_n|$ for sufficiently large n , then the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges absolutely.

######**Limit comparison test:**
If $\left \{ a_n \right \}, \left \{ b_n \right \} > 0$, and the limit $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n}$ exists, is finite and is not zero, then $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges if and only if $\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n$ converges.

######**Cauchy condensation test:**
Let $\left \{ a_n \right \}$ be a positive non-increasing sequence. Then the sum $A = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges if and only if the sum $A^* = \sum_{n=0}^\infty 2^n a_{2^n}$ converges. Moreover, if they converge, then $A \leq A^* \leq 2A$ holds.

######**Abel's test:** 
Suppose the following statements are true:

- $\sum a_n$  is a convergent series, and
- ${b_n}$ is a bounded monotone sequence.

Then $\sum a_nb_n$  is also convergent.

######**Alternating series test:**
This is also known as the Leibniz criterion. If

- $\{a_n\}$ is a sequence monotonically decreasing sequence of positive numbers, and
- $\lim_{n \to \infty}a_n=0$.

Then $\sum (-1)^na_n$ is convergent.
