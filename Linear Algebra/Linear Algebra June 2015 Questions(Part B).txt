**Question 1:** Which of the following is a linear transformation from $\Bbb R^3$ to $\Bbb R^2$.

a. $f\left( \matrix{x \cr y \cr z} \right) = \left( \matrix{4 \cr x+y}\right)$
b. $g\left( \matrix{x \cr y \cr z} \right) =  \left( \matrix{xy \cr x+y}\right)$
c. $h\left( \matrix{x \cr y \cr z} \right) =  \left( \matrix{z -x  \cr x+y}\right)$

1. only $f$.
2. only $g$.
3. only $h$.
4.  all the transformations $f$, $g$ and $h$.

**Answer:** The presence of constant term, 4 in $f$ and quadratic term, $xy$ in $g$ will make these function non-linear. 

Hence option **3** is correct choice.

**Question 2:** Let $T$ be a $4 \times 4$ real matrix such that $T^4 = 0$. Let $k_i = \text{dim Ker }T^i  $ for $1 \leq i \leq 4$. Which of the following is NOT a possibility for the sequence $k_1 \leq k_2 \leq k_3 \leq k_4$?

1. $3 \leq 4 \leq 4 \leq 4$.
2. $1 \leq 3 \leq 4 \leq 4$.
3. $2 \leq 4 \leq 4 \leq 4$.
4. $2 \leq 3 \leq 4 \leq 4$.

**Answer:** The given matrix satisfies $T^4 = 0$, hence it's minimal polynomial will be a factor of $x^4$. Hence we have four choice of minimal polynomials, $m(x) = x, x^2, x^3, x^4$. Also note that $0$ is the only eigenvalue of the matrix $T$.

If $m(x) = x$, since minimal polynomial is composed of linear factors then the Jordan form of $T$ will be diagonal, $i.e.$,
$$ J[T] = \pmatrix{0 & 0 &  0 & 0 \cr 0 & 0 &  0 & 0 \cr 0 & 0 &  0 & 0 \cr 0 & 0 &  0 & 0 }.$$
Since the rank of this matrix and it's higher powers are $0$, then the possible sequence of $k$'s($4 - $ rank)  are $4 \leq 4 \leq 4 \leq 4$.

If $m(x) = x^2$, then Jordan form of $T$ will consist of jordan block of order $\leq 2$. Here we have two choices of $J[T]$
$$ J[T] = \pmatrix{0 & 1 &   &  \cr 0 & 0 &   &  \cr  &  &  0 & 1 \cr  &  &  0 & 0 } \text{ or }  \pmatrix{0 & 1 &   &  \cr 0 & 0 &   &  \cr  &  &  0 &  \cr  &  &   & 0 } .$$

On squaring both the matrix will become zero matrix, but rank of 1st is $2$ while the rank of second is $1$, hence the sequene of $k$'s will be 
$2 \leq 4 \leq 4 \leq 4$ and $3 \leq 4 \leq 4 \leq 4$.

If $m(x) = x^3$, then Jordan form of $T$ will consist of Jordan block of order  $\leq 3$, 
$$ J[T] = \pmatrix{0 & 1 &   &  \cr  & 0 &  1 &  \cr  &  &  0 &  \cr  &  &   & 0 } .$$

This matrix has a [nilpotent matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilpotent_matrix) of order 3, on squaring it's rank will decreased by one and cubing will further reduce it's rank by one and so on. Hence rank of this matrix is 2 at first, on power it's will become 1, 0 and 0,  the sequene of $k$'s will be $2 \leq 3 \leq 4 \leq 4$

Finally if $m(x) = x^4$, then Jordan form of $T$ will consist of jordan block of order $\leq 4$, 
$$ J[T] = \pmatrix{0 & 1 &   &  \cr  & 0 &  1 &  \cr  &  &  0 & 1 \cr  &  &   & 0 } .$$

This is a nilpotent matrix of order $4$ hence the sequence of rank for the powers of $T$ will be $3, 2, 1 $ and $0$, hence the sequene of $k$'s will be $1 \leq 2 \leq 3 \leq 4$.

Since the sequence in option **2** does not belongs to any of these Jordan blocks.

Hence **2** is correct choice.

**Question 3:** Let $A,B$ be $n \times n $ matrices. Which of the following equals trace($A^2B^2$)?

1. (trace($A^2B^2$))$^2$
2. trace($AB^2A$)
3. trace(($AB$)$^2$)
4. trace($BABA$)

**Answer:**  As we know that, 
> <center>trace($AB$) = trace($BA$)</center>

We have, trace($A^2B^2$) $=$ trace($AAB^2$) = trace($AB^2A$).

Hence **2** is the correct choice.

**Question 4:**  Let $A$ be $m \times n $ matrix of rank $n$ with real entries. Choose the correct statement.

1. $Ax = b$ has a solution for any $b$.
2. $Ax = 0$ does not have a solution. 
3. If $Ax = b$ has a solution, then it is unique.
4. $y'A = 0$ for some nonzero $y$, where $y'$ denotes the transpose of the vector $y$

**Answer:** Since the rank of $A$ is equal to it's column, hence it's every column will contain a pivot and this will result in unique solution.

Hence **3** is correct choice.

****
**Question 5:**  Let $V$ be the space of twice differential functions of $\Bbb R$ satisfying $ f'' - 2f ' + f =0 $.
Define $T: V \rightarrow \Bbb R^2$ by $T(f) = (f'(0), f(0))$. Then the $T$ is 

1. one-to-one and onto.
2. one-to-one but not onto.
3. onto but not one-to-one.
4. neither one-to-one nor onto.

**Answer:**  The two fundamental solution will be $e^{x}$ and $xe^{x}$, taking this as a basis of $V$ and standard basis of $\Bbb R^2$, the matrix of linear transformation will be computed as 
$T(e^{x}) = (1,1)$ and $T(xe^{x}) = (1,0)$, hence 
$$m(T) = \pmatrix{1 & 1 \cr 1 & 0 }$$
The matrix is invertible, hence the given linear transformation will be one-one and onto.

Hence **1** is correct choice.

****
**Question 6:** The row space of a $20 \times 50$ matrix $A$ has dimension $13$. What is the dimension of the space of solutions of $Ax = 0$?

$1. ~7 \quad 2. ~13 \quad 3. ~ 33 \quad 4.~ 37$

**Answer:** The rank of $A$ is $13$, hence the dimension of its nullspace(number of non-pivot columns) will be $50 - 13 = 37$.

Hence **4** correct choice.
