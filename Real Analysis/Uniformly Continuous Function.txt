**Question 1:** Which of the following real-valued function on $(0,1)$ is uniformly  continuous?

1. $\cfrac{1}{x} \quad $
2. $\cfrac{\sin x}{x}$ 
3. $\sin \frac{1}{x} $  
4. $\cfrac{\cos x}{x}$

**Answer:** 
> **Continuous Extension Theorem:** A function $f$ is uniformly continuous on a bounded set $A\subset \Bbb R$ if and only if we can extend this to a continuous function from $\overline{A}$ to $\Bbb R$.

Here the given set is $(0,1)$ and it's closure will be $[0,1]$, by above theorem a function that is uniformly continuous on $(0,1)$ if it is continuous on $[0,1]$. At $x=0$, functions $\frac{1}{x}$, $\sin \frac{1}{x}$ and $\frac{\cos x}{x}$ are can not have finite limits. 

While $\frac{\sin x}{x}$ not defined on $0$ but we can assign it $1$ at $x=0$ such that function become continuous on $[0,1]$. Hence it is uniformly continuous.

Hence **2** is correct choice.

**Question 2:** Let $A \subset \Bbb R$ and $f:A \rightarrow \Bbb R$ be given by $f(x) = x^2$. Then $f$ is uniformly continuous if 

1. $A$ is a bounded  subset of $\Bbb R$ 
2. $A$ is a dense  subset of $\Bbb R$ 
3. $A$ is a unbounded and connected subset of $\Bbb R$ 
4. $A$ is a unbounded and open subset of $\Bbb R$ 

**Answer:** By continuous extension theorem, $A$ has to be bounded.

Hence **1** is correct choice.

**Question 3:** Let $f:(0,1) \rightarrow \Bbb R$ be continuous. Suppose that $|f(x) - f(y)| \leq |\sin x - \sin y|$ for all $x, y \in (0,1)$. Then 

1. $f$ is discontinuous at least one point in $(0,1)$
2. $f$ is continuous everywhere on  $(0,1)$, but not uniformly continuous on $(0,1)$
3. $f$ is uniformly continuous on $(0,1)$
4. $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0+} f(x)$ exists

**Answer:** Let $g(x)=\sin x$ and $\vert g'(x) \vert = \vert \cos x \vert \leq 1$, then by mean value theorem, for all $x,y$ we have 
$$\vert \sin x - \sin y \vert \leq 1 \cdot  \vert x - y \vert \tag{*}.$$

Using $(*)$, we get 
$$|f(x) - f(y)| \leq |\sin x - \sin y| \leq \vert x - y \vert$$

Hence $f$ satisfy Lipschitz condition hence it is uniformly continuous.
>A function satisfying [Lipschitz condition](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LipschitzFunction.html) is uniformly continuous.

Also by continuous extension theorem a function uniformly continuous can extend to continuous function on it's closure, hence $f$ is continuous on $0 \Rightarrow \lim_{x\rightarrow 0+} f(x)$ exists.

Hence **3 and 4** are correct choice.
