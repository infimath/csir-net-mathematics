A differential equation is called **autonomous** if it has no independent term. Hence a first order general ode will look like
$$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = f(y) \phantom{csir net}\text{  [Independent of $t$]}.$$

**Qualitative Treatment of Autonomous ODE**
**STEP I:** Find the critical points $y_0$(solution of $f(y)=0$). These are horizontal solution of the given ode.

Since two solutions(called integral curve) can't intersect, hence other solution will be in the region bounded by these horizontal solution.
**STEP II:** As we have partition the space with horizontal solution, now identify the region with $f(y)>0$ and $f(y)<0$.

As we know that 
\begin{align*}
\left [\dfrac{dy}{dt} = f(y) \right ]
\begin{matrix} >0 &\Rightarrow y(t)\text{ is increasing}\\
<0 &\Rightarrow y(t)\text{ is decreasing}
\end{matrix}
\end{align*}
Hence the solution will look like

Now we will apply these concept to a question of CSIR-NET.


**Question:** Let $y:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfy the initial value problem 
$$y'(t)=1-y^2,t\in \mathbb{R},~y(0)=0.$$ Then 


1. $y(t_1)=1$ for some $t\in R$. 
2. $y(t)>-1$ for all $t\in R$.
3. $y$ is strictly increasing in $\mathbb{R}$. 
4. $y$ is increasing in $(0, 1)$ and decreasing in $(1,\infty)$. 

**Answer:** Here $f(y)=1-y^2=(1-y)(1+y)$, so $y=\pm 1$ are two horizontal solution of the given ode
\begin{matrix}
\text{Region 1}&y > 1 & f(y) < 0 & y(t) \text{ is decreasing}\\
\text{Region 2}&-1>y>1 & f(y) > 0 &y(t) \text{ is increasing}\\
\text{Region 3}&y <-1 & f(y) < 0 & y(t) \text{ is decreasing}\\
\end{matrix}
The required integral curve will pass through $(0,0)$, which lies in region 2, so the solution is increasing and bounded by $y \in (-1,1)$. Here 2nd and 4th option are correct.

Hence **2 and 4** are correct choices.
