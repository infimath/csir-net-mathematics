title: Autonomous First Order ODE
tags: [Autonomous]

A differential equation is called **autonomous** if it has no independent term. Hence a first order general ode will look like
$$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = f(y) \phantom{csir net}\text{  [Independent of $t$]}.$$

**Qualitative Treatment of Autonomous ODE**
**STEP I:** Find the critical points $y_0$(solution of $f(y)=0$). These are horizontal solution of the given ode.

Since two solutions(called integral curve) can't intersect, hence other solution will be in the region bounded by these horizontal solution.
**STEP II:** As we have partition the space with horizontal solution, now identify the region with $f(y)>0$ and $f(y)<0$.

**STEP III:** As we know that 
\begin{align*}
\left [\dfrac{dy}{dt} = f(y) \right ]
\begin{matrix} >0 &\Rightarrow y(t)\text{ is increasing}\\
<0 &\Rightarrow y(t)\text{ is decreasing}
\end{matrix}
\end{align*}
Hence the solution will look like

**NOTE 1:** Since $f(y)$ is independent of $t$, all solution in a region will be translation of a particular solution along the $t-$axis.
**NOTE 2:** Solution tends to converge towards $y_1$ in the neighborhood of $y_1$, which an example of a stable critical point. While solutions tend to diverge form $y_2$ in the neighborhood of $y_2$, which is an example of unstable critical point.

**Question 1:** Let $P$ be a polynomial of degree $N$, with $N \geq 2$. Then the initial value problem $$u'(t)=P(u(t)),~u(0)=1$$ has always

1. A unique sloution in $\mathbb{R}$
2. $N$ number of distinct solution in $\mathbb{R}$
3. No solution in any interval containing $0$ for some $P$.
4. A unique solution in an interval containing $0$.

**Answer:** This is a autonomous ODE with $y=u(t)$, and the solution (integral curve) will pass through $(0,1)$. Since only one integral curve will pass through any point, hence we get a unique solution in an interval containing $0$. 

Hence **1** is correct choice.

**Question 2:** Let $y_1(x)$ and $y_1(x)$ be the solution of the differential equation $\dfrac{dy}{dt} = y + 17$ with initial condition $y_1(0)=0,y_2(0)=1$. Then 

1. $y_1$ and $y_2$ will never intersect.
2. $y_1$ and $y_2$ will intersect at $x=17$.
3. $y_1$ and $y_2$ will intersect at $x=e$.
4. $y_1$ and $y_2$ will intersect at $x=1$.

**Answer:** Here $y_1$ and $y_2$ pass through $(0,0)$ and $(0,1)$ respectively. Horizontal solution will pass through $y = -17$, both the point lies the region above it and the solution will be increasing, so it can't pass through two vertical points.

Hence **1** is correct choice.

**Question 3:** The differential equation $\dfrac{dy}{dt} =60(y^2)^{1/5};x>0~y(0)=0$ has 

1. a unique solution. 
3. no solution. 
2. two solutions. 
4. infinite number of solutions. 

**Answer:** Here the horizontal solution is the $x-$axis($y=0$). The given point lies in this line, hence unique solution.

Hence **1** is correct choice.  

******
**Question 4:** Consider the initial value problem (IVP) 
$$\dfrac{dy}{dt}=y^2, y(0)=1, (x,y)\in \mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}.$$ Then there exists a unique solution of the IVP on 

1. $(- \infty, \infty)$
2. $(- \infty, 1) $
3. $(-2,2)$
4.  $(1, \infty)$

**Answer:** Here $x-$axis is the only horizontal solution of the ODE. This will also partition the plane in upper($y>0$) and lower($y<0$). Since the point $(0,1)$ in upper half plane hence we get unique solution in $(1, \infty)$ only.

Hence **4** is correct choice.

*****
**Question 5:** Let $y:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfy the initial value problem 
$$y'(t)=1-y^2,t\in \mathbb{R},~y(0)=0.$$ Then 


1. $y(t_1)=1$ for some $t\in R$. 
2. $y(t)>-1$ for all $t\in R$.
3. $y$ is strictly increasing in $\mathbb{R}$. 
4. $y$ is increasing in $(0, 1)$ and decreasing in $(1,\infty)$. 

**Answer:** Here $f(y)=1-y^2=(1-y)(1+y)$, so $y=\pm 1$ are two horizontal solution of the given ode
\begin{matrix}
\text{Region 1}&y > 1 & f(y) < 0 & y(t) \text{ is decreasing}\\
\text{Region 2}&-1>y>1 & f(y) > 0 &y(t) \text{ is increasing}\\
\text{Region 3}&y <-1 & f(y) < 0 & y(t) \text{ is decreasing}\\
\end{matrix}
The required integral curve will pass through $(0,0)$, which lies in region 2, so the solution is increasing and bounded by $y \in (-1,1)$. Here 2nd and 4th option are correct.

Hence **2 and 4** are correct choices.
